# twitter_siphon

While browsing the code, you should keep in mind three things. First, this project began as a fork of WilliamStrong's private repository. He's cool and can code the things. You should check out his projects. Because of this, however, I am in the process of cleaning up the repository. Secondly, the project is predominantly a research project, so there are some unused modules which will be pruned out at a later point.

There are two main parts to this project. The database controller module is in charge of accessing, reading from and writing to the database. The trends controller is responsible for monitoring real-time trends on Twitter, and collecting the neessary articles for the front-end application (coming soon) to serve.
